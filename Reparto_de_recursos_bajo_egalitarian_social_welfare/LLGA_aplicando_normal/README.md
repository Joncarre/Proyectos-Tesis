# LLGA with Normal Distribution Applied to Preferences ðŸ“Š

This project showcases a variation of the **Lower-Level Genetic Algorithm (LLGA)** that integrates the concept of the normal probability distribution.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Normal Distribution Basics
> The normal distribution (or Gaussian distribution) is a fundamental continuous probability distribution widely used in statistics and probability theory.
> *   It is completely characterized by two parameters: its **mean (Î¼)** and its **standard deviation (Ïƒ)**.
> *   By adjusting Î¼ and Ïƒ, we can generate random values that cluster around the mean, with the spread determined by the standard deviation.

## Integration with LLGA

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The mechanism of the normal distribution is incorporated into this specific LLGA implementation. This enhancement allows for the application of normally distributed deviations to the preferences of the agents involved in the resource allocation problem. This can be useful for simulating noise or uncertainty in agent preferences during experiments.
